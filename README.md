Introduction
------------

Ingress Dual map is an app that runs alongside the official Ingress app, and shows notifications when portals are nearby.  These allow the tracking of distance, hack counts, cooldown times and burnout times, all from within the notification.


Caveats
-------

There is currently no way to add portals - a selection of portals in Cambridge, UK are hardcoded in during development.  In the future, the app will hopefully be able to import lists, or allow marking of custom portals at the user's current location.
